# Computer-Vision
Computer vision personal project

Executive Summary:
In this project, I have developed my working understanding of computer vision. This python project can interpret visual input from the webcam and perform operations based on the position of the hands that it sees. 

From this interpretation, I have experimented with a wide range of applications of this.

Future Iterations:
1. Increased tolerance of edge cases for hand positions.
2. Understanding of more complex hand gestures.
