# Computer-Vision
Computer vision personal project

In this project, I aimed to develop my working understanding of computer vision. This python project can interpret visual input from the webcam and interpret the position of the individuals hands. It is then able to perform particular actions, such as count fingers and more. 

Future iterations will have an increased tolerance of edge cases for hand positions. It will also be able to perform complex operations based on specific hand positions.
